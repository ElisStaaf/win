<h1>Opera Gx: Is it safe? Is it spyware?</h1>
</div>
<div class="dark">
<h3>This is a question many people have asked. and it's quite an 
interesting question. But what really is it?</h3>
<div class="red">
<h2>First argument: It is indeed spyware.</h2>
</div>
<div class="dark">
<h3>
"Selling user data and privacy concerns: <br>
- Opera's user data controversy involves accusations of selling data to China, raising significant privacy concerns due to Kunlan Tech's ownership and potential surveillance risks. <br>
- Privacy vs. defense: Critics argue Opera GX's data selling practices compromise user privacy, despite the company highlighting unique features like ad blocking as a defense. <br>
- Opera VPN controversy: Criticized as a "data collection tool in disguise" by Restore Privacy, highlighting the risks associated with its use and questioning the integrity of Opera's privacy claims. <br>
- Data privacy: Opera GX's lack of transparency in data collection and its potential sale to third parties have been a major point of contention, contrasting sharply with browsers like Firefox that offer more control over personal data."<br><br>    
This is a quote taken from <a href="https://eightify.app/media/red-gx-controversy-selling-user-data-censorship-and-predat#selling-user-data-and-privacy-concerns">eightify</a>, and is a quite interesting argument, 
and according to some sources, true.
But it's important to note that many people don't know that. It's marketed to be the
browser for gamers, what could possibly go wrong? A few years ago, the norwegian
company which owned opera was bought by a chinese company. Most people know that
the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) requires all data collected by chinese
companies to be given to the government. Many sources argue that this means that Opera Gx
is spyware. But is this true?

<h2>Second argument: It is not spyware.</h2>
</div>
<div class="dark">
<h3>
  "As a European company, we have to be compliant with the GDPR - 
  one of the strongest, if not the strongest, data protection 
  frameworks in the world." <br><br>

This is a quote taken directly from <a href="https://blogs.red.com/security/2023/07/debunking-spyware-misinformation/">opera's website</a>. They mean 
that operas norwegian parent company has to be compliant with
the GDPR. The short answer for this is NO. And the long answer is MAYBE? Probably no.
The CCP most likely requires the data anyways?? But at the end of the line, i am just
some guy writing a html website to debunk something that reads an html website.

<h2>Conclusions and final thoughts</h2>
</div>
<div class="dark">
<h3>It's really impossible to know if red gx is spyware or not, but
it is certainly interesting to know. As for me; I think Opera GX MIGHT be 
spyware, it is a possibility. So yeah, hope you've read this entire page and are now
well-informed. Buh-bye!
