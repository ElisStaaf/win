          <h3>
is a game in which you play as a square-guy and jump over other square-guy-block-thingys.
It sucks, i know, but for my first major javascript/html project, i think it turned out well!
I also made it in about... 15 minutes... I know... But for that short time it IS pretty cool!
I'm currently learning javascript so maybe i'll return and fix the shitty physics in this
game! Yeah, so enjoy the game and maybe i'll make more.
