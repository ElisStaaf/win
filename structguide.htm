        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to STRUCT, your new data manager. Have some data to keep 
                        track of employees, projects or investors? Don't use CSV, use
                        STRUCT! STRUCT was made in python, and managed in python, so, 
                        let's get started!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Get started</h2>
                    <p>First, download STRUCT from github. Then, and only then,
                        can you get started. To begin, create a python file.
                        Name it something useful, like <comment>index.py</comment>
                        and then open it. Then, write the following:<br><br>
                        <orange>from</orange> <blue>structs</blue> <orange>import</orange> <red>StructParser</red><br><br>
                        NOW, you should create a STRUCT, file, it's generally
                        good practice to name it the same as the python file,
                        so <comment>index.struct</comment>.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Structure your database</h2>
                    <p>Values in STRUCT are separated by ":". The first row should
                        be the category of the values, for example, say that you
                        wan't to manage employees of a small company. You would
                        write this inside of the <comment>index.struct</comment> file:<br><br>
                        <blue>name</blue>:<green>department</green>:<red>age</red><br>
                        John:Sales:30<br>
                        Jane:Marketing:28<br>
                        Mark:Finance:35<br><br>
                        Here, we defined three people with three
                        different attributes: name, department and age.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Use your STRUCT</h2>
                    <p>Your database is almost ready! You just need
                        to send your STRUCT to your database! Firstly, have your database ready,
                        for demonstration purposes, it will be named <comment>index_db.txt</comment>.
                        Have the database ready!
                        This is the updated <comment>index.py</comment> file:<br><br>
                        <orange>from</orange> <blue>structs</blue> <orange>import</orange> <red>StructParser</red><br>
                        <blue>parser</blue> = <red>StructParser</red>(<green>"index.struct"</green>)<br>
                        <blue>parser</blue>.<red>make</red>(<green>"index_db.txt"</green>)<br><br>
                        This will push the changes you've made to the database! Let's take a look!<br><br>
                        <blue>name</blue>,John,Jane,Mark<br>
                        <green>department</green>,Sales,Marketing,Finance<br>
                        <red>age</red>,30,38,35<br>
                        <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    Yeah, so STRUCT is an easy and intuitive open-source 
                    data-manager, the YOU, (or your company) should use!
                    Goodbye!
